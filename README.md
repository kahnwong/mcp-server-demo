# mcp-server-demo

## MCP Client

See <https://modelcontextprotocol.info/docs/clients/>

In this project I use [5ire](https://github.com/nanbingxyz/5ire)

## Usage

You have to install the mcp server as a system binary, then reference it in your MCP client.

For 5ire, see [docs](https://github.com/nanbingxyz/5ire?tab=readme-ov-file#%EF%B8%8F-support-tools-via-mcp-servers)
